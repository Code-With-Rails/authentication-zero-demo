Hey there,

A new device just signed in to your account (<%= @session.user.email %>).

<%= @session.user_agent %>

<%= @session.created_at %>

<%= @session.ip_address %>

If this was you, carry on. We could notify you about sign-ins from this device again.

If you don't recognize this device, someone else may have accessed your account. You should immediately [change your password]<%= new_identity_password_reset_url %>.

Tip: It's a good idea to periodically review all of the [devices and sessions]<%= sessions_url %> in your account for suspicious activity.
